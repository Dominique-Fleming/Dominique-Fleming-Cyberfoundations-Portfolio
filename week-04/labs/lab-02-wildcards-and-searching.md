# Week 4 Lab — The Archive Investigation (CLI Simulator)

**Student Name:** Dominique D Fleming

**Date Completed:** August 16, 2026

**Module:** 1 — Digital Infrastructure & CLI | **Week:** 4  
**Submission Path:** `week-04/labs/lab-02-wildcards-and-searching.md`

---

## Overview

Lesson 2 gave you the Archive's two tools: patterns that match many filenames at once, and the magnet — `grep` — that searches *inside* files. This lab hands you an Archive of your own and a request slip with three jobs on it: match a set of files with patterns (Part A), hunt down a suspicious log entry with grep (Part B), and run the full find → check → lock down audit that combines this week's two lessons into one workflow (Part C). This lab is more independent than Lab 01 — like Week 3's Scavenger Hunt, the steps tell you *what* to accomplish, and the *how* is on you. One screenshot from this lab becomes part of ★ Deliverable 1.

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| Environment | CyberFoundations CLI Simulator (browser-based, inside the Lab Portal) |
| Shell | Your choice — bash or PowerShell. The steps below show bash syntax; the Lesson 2 Resource Pack's Quick Reference has the PowerShell equivalents |
| Prerequisite | Week 4, Lessons 1 and 2 completed; Lab 01 recommended first |

**Before you start:** log into the Lab Portal, open **Week 4 → CLI Simulator**, and load the **"Foundry District Archive Investigation"** scenario. It seeds a folder of several dozen files — logs, invoices, notes — far too many to open one at a time. Good.

---

## Part A — Work the Request Slip

### Step 1 — Survey the Archive

Before filtering anything, look at what you're working with: run a plain listing of the Archive folder. You don't need to record every filename — just note roughly how many files there are and what naming families you can see (invoices, logs, notes…).

What you observed (rough count + the naming families you spotted):

```
11 files -invoices, logs and notes
```

### Step 2 — Match One Family With a Pattern

The slip's first request: **every invoice file.** Write a pattern that matches all of them and *only* them, and test it with `ls` — remember the habit: pattern first, look at what it catches, then act.

Command you ran (your ls + pattern):

```
ls inv-*
```

Output (the matched files):

```
inv-april.txt
inv-february.txt
inv-january.txt
inv-march-supplement.txt
inv-march.txt
```

### Step 3 — Get Precise

The slip gets pickier: **only the invoices from a single month** (the scenario panel tells you which). Refine your pattern so it catches exactly those — you may need a second `*`, a `?`, or a `[ ]` set, depending on how the names are built.

Command you ran:

```
ls inv-*march*
```

Output (the matched files — and nothing extra):

```
ls inv-*march*
```

### Step 4 — Act on a Pattern

Create a folder named `evidence` and copy your Step 3 matches into it with a single `cp` command using your pattern. Confirm the copies landed with `ls evidence`.

Commands you ran (mkdir, cp with pattern, confirming ls):

```
mkdir evidence
cp inv-*march* evidence
ls
```

---

## Part B — Run the Magnet

### Step 1 — Search One File

The slip's second request: the scenario's access log records badge events, and somewhere in it are **denied entries**. Search the log the scenario panel names for the word `denied` — and remember the Strict Teacher: decide whether you need the case-insensitive flag.

Command you ran:

```
grep -i denied *.log
```

Output (every matching line):

```
door-access.log:08:12 DENIED badge 2214 east door - retry OK
door-access.log:12:40 DENIED visitor badge front desk
door-access.log:02:47 DENIED badge 4471 storeroom door

```

### Step 2 — Find the Line That Matters

Most denied entries are routine — mistyped badges at reasonable hours. One is not. Identify the suspicious line (think: what *time* would worry you?) and record it exactly.

The suspicious line, and why you flagged it:

```
door-access.log:02:47 DENIED badge 4471 storeroom door
```

### Step 3 — Widen the Sweep

One log is never the whole story. Re-run your search across **every** log file in one command — a pattern where the filename goes. Note which files your suspicious word appears in.

Command you ran:

```
grep -i denied *.log
```

Which files contained matches:

```
west-access.log:13:22 DENIED badge 9911 west door - unknown badge
```

---

## Part C — Find, Check, Lock Down

The slip's last request is the real test: **somewhere in this Archive is a file listing storeroom badge codes.** You don't know its name. You know what's inside it.

### Step 1 — Find It by Its Contents

Search every text file for the term the scenario panel gives you, in one command. Record which file comes back.

Command you ran:

```
grep -i badge-code *.txt
```

The file you found:

```
meeting-recap.txt
```

### Step 2 — Check Who Can Touch It

Before you walk away — this is the Week 4 reflex now — run the long listing on that file and read its rings. Record what you find. Is this file as locked down as its contents deserve?

Command you ran and its output:

```
ls -l meeting-recap.txt -rw-rw-rw- 1 morgan foundry   129 meeting-recap.txt
```

Your read of the situation:

```
The owner, the group and everybody else(other) has permission to read and write
```

### Step 3 — Lock It Down

Fix the file's permissions so only its owner can read and write it — Gatekeeper's Rule applies: check, change, check again.

Commands you ran (including both ls -l checks):

```
ls -l meeting-recap.txt
chmod g-rw meeting-recap.txt
chmod o-rw meeting-recap.txt
ls -l meeting-recap.txt

```

The file's permission string BEFORE and AFTER:

```
-rw-rw-rw- 1 morgan foundry   129 meeting-recap.txt
-rw------- 1 morgan foundry   129 meeting-recap.txt
```

### Step 4 — Capture Your Investigation Evidence (REQUIRED screenshot)

Take one screenshot of your simulator session showing your Part C sequence — the search that found the file, the permission check, and the fix. **This screenshot is required — it is part of ★ Deliverable 1.** Name it `cli-search-investigation.png`. Upload and embed it via the GitHub Commit section below.

## Analysis Questions

**Analysis Question 1.** In Part A you tested every pattern with `ls` before letting `cp` act on it. Explain what could go wrong if you skipped straight to acting — and why the stakes get higher when the command attached to the pattern is `rm`. *(Minimum 2 sentences.)*

```
If you go straight to acting on "cp" before using "ls" you could copy a file that you didn't mean to copy to somewhere it doesn't belong bc you could match more than what you expected. It could be worse if you act on "rm" before checking because anything the pattern matches could be deleted permanently
```

**Analysis Question 2.** Your Part B search returned several routine matches and one suspicious one. In a real security job, why is "reducing six hundred lines to three worth reading" often more valuable than any single answer the search returns? *(Minimum 2 sentences.)*

```
Time can be the difference between preventing a major incident and suffering major losses. If I can narrow six hundred lines down to the three that actually matter, I can investigate faster, make better decisions, and help the teams protecting the company, its people, and its data respond more effectively.
```

**Analysis Question 3.** Part C found a sensitive file by its *contents*, then audited its *permissions*. Explain why neither skill alone would have been enough — what does each half of the workflow catch that the other misses? *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
Finding the sensitive file tells you where the problem is, but it doesn’t tell you who can access or change it. Checking the permissions tells you who can touch the file, but that doesn’t help much if you can’t find the risky file in the first place. Together, those skills help a defender quickly locate the problem, understand the risk, and take action to secure it.
```

**Analysis Question 4.** The Archive had dozens of files; real systems have millions. Which habit from this lab do you think scales up the furthest into professional work, and why? *(Minimum 2 sentences.)*

```
I think using grep -i with wildcards scales up the furthest because it is like having eyes across the whole tree structure at once instead of checking files one by one. In cybersecurity, that kind of speed and visibility is crucial because it helps defenders find suspicious activity faster and keep up with potential attacks.
```

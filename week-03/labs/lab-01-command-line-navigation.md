# Week 3 Lab — Navigate Your First File System (CLI Simulator)

**Student Name:** Dominique Fleming

**Date Completed:** August 5th, 2026

**Module:** 1 — Digital Infrastructure & CLI | **Week:** 3  
**Submission Path:** `week-03/labs/lab-01-command-line-navigation.md`

---

## Overview

Lesson 3 introduced your first five commands — finding where you are, looking around, moving through folders, peeking inside a file, and asking for help — in both bash and PowerShell. This lab has you apply those same five commands to a brand-new scenario inside the CLI Simulator, on your own, then connect what you find back to the file-system tree you learned to read in Lessons 1 and 2.

**Nothing here can break anything real.** The CLI Simulator is a consequence-free practice space — if you type something wrong, the worst outcome is an error message telling you so.

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| Environment | CyberFoundations CLI Simulator (browser-based, inside the Lab Portal) — no install, no VM, no real terminal required |
| Shell | Your choice — bash or PowerShell. Try the same steps in both if you want extra practice; only one is required |
| Prerequisite | Lessons 1, 2, and 3 completed |

**Before you start:** log into the Lab Portal, open **Week 3 → CLI Simulator**, and load the **"Foundry District Shift Log"** scenario. This gives you a fresh, seeded set of folders and files you haven't seen before — that's intentional, so you're navigating for real, not just repeating the lesson's example.

---

## Part A — Find Your Way

### Step 1 — Open the Scenario and Check Your Starting Point

Load the Foundry District Shift Log scenario and run the command that tells you where you currently are (`pwd` in bash, `Get-Location` in PowerShell).

Command you ran:

```
pwd
```

Output (your current path):

```
/home/morgan
```

### Step 2 — Look Around

Run the command that lists what's in your current location (`ls` in bash, `dir` in PowerShell).

Command you ran:

```
ls
```

Output (files/folders listed):

```
README.md intake, maintenance and logs
```

### Step 3 — Predict Before You Move

Before moving anywhere, look at the folder names from Step 2 and guess which one might contain a shift log or notes file. Write your guess down first — you'll check it in Part B.

My guess:

```
logs
```

---

## Part B — Move and Peek

### Step 1 — Move Into a Folder

Use `cd` (with a folder name from Step 2 as its argument) to move into the folder you guessed in Part A, Step 3.

Command you ran:

```
cd logs
```

### Step 2 — Confirm Your New Location

Run `pwd` or `Get-Location` again to confirm exactly where you landed.

Command you ran:

```
pwd
```

Output (your new path):

```
/home/morgan/logs
```

### Step 3 — Look Around Again

Run `ls` or `dir` again in this new location. Keep moving with `cd` (repeating Steps 1–3 as needed) until you find a text file — something like a shift log, notes file, or README.

Command you ran:

```
ls
```

Output:

```
shift-log.txt
```

### Step 4 — Peek Inside the File

Once you've found a text file, use `cat` (bash) or `type` (PowerShell) to read its contents.

Command you ran:

```
cat packing-slip.txt
```

File contents:

```
Shift Log - Foundry District
06:00- all systems nominal
14:00 routine inspection complete
22:00- handoff to night shift
```

### Step 5 — Move Back Up

Use `cd ..` at least once to move back up a level, and confirm with `pwd`/`Get-Location` that the path changed the way you expected.

Command you ran:

```
cd ..
```

Output (confirming your new — higher — location):

```
morgan@foundry-wks-02:/home/morgan$
```

---

## Part C — Ask for Help

### Step 1 — Pick an Unfamiliar Command

The CLI Simulator's Foundry District scenario includes one command you haven't been taught yet, shown as a hint in the scenario panel. Instead of guessing what it does, ask the terminal directly.

### Step 2 — Run the Help Command

Use `--help` or `man` (bash) or `Get-Help` (PowerShell) on that unfamiliar command.

Command you ran:

```
man grep
```

What the help text told you the command does, in your own words:

```
Basically it is looking for things that are similar or have a pattern if there are a lot of files to look thru
```

## Analysis Questions

### Analysis Question 1

Look at the path `pwd` (or `Get-Location`) printed in Part A, Step 1. Is it written in Windows style or Linux style, and how do you know? Reference at least one specific detail from Lesson 2 (a drive letter, a slash direction, or the presence of a ~) to support your answer.

```
"pwd" in Part A Step 1 is in Windows style because it ignores the strict rules about capitalization.Linux is very strict on capitalization because it means 2 different things is a letter is lowercase or capitalized. Also you could tell there is no need for "~" which would have not been an issue but its just a clear difference to me.
```

### Analysis Question 2

In Part B, you ran `pwd`/`Get-Location` right after moving with `cd`, more than once. Explain why that "move, then check" habit matters, especially while you're still building confidence with the command line.

```
Using "pwd" after "cd" each time to keep the habit "move then check" matters because as a newbie I can easily move too fast or overlook the folder or subfolder I am in and make a vital or critical mistake or something I was not supposed to edit/change/delete. This makes sure I am confident in where , what and why I am making a change before I make the change.
```

### Analysis Question 3

In Part C, you looked up a command you'd never used before, instead of guessing or skipping it. Explain why this habit — asking the terminal for help instead of memorizing everything in advance — matters for a real career in IT or cybersecurity.

```
In Part C using the "man _" command to help me look up what I have never used before was smart habit to build because if/when I am being taught by my teammates or others and I learn commands it will be a lot to retain so some of the information I will forget the purpose behind but instead of having to ask them I can simply ask the terminal which is programmed to know those commands already and just needs to educate me so I can utilize then in the correct time and place.
```

### Analysis Question 4

Compare this lab to Lesson 1's filing-room analogy (the pile of paper vs. the labeled cabinets). Now that you've actually navigated a file-system tree yourself instead of just reading about one, what — if anything — surprised you or felt different from what you expected?

```
I think that it surprised me on how the pathways continued to show my travel into the subfolders that kept branching off. Also, how the system told me that the path I was on did not contain what I thought it did(because I didn't check before I moved lo

## GitHub Commit Subsection

This lab's written answers are submitted the same way as Week 2's: through the **CyberFoundations Lab Portal**, not by typing directly into GitHub.

1. Go to the CyberFoundations Lab Portal and sign in with your student Microsoft account.
2. Open **Week 3 → Lab 01: Navigate Your First File System**.
3. Fill in the worksheet fields — they match the commands, outputs, and questions in this file.
4. Connect your GitHub account if you haven't already (one-time setup), and select your portfolio repo.
5. Click **Submit to GitHub**. The Portal commits the completed file to `week-03/labs/lab-01-command-line-navigation.md` for you — no manual typing or commit needed for this part.

**📌 Optional — add a screenshot for your portfolio.** This entire step is optional. Skipping it will **not** affect your grade — it's a nice-to-have addition to your portfolio, not a requirement. Only do this if you'd like a visual record of your CLI Simulator session.

If you'd like to add one, take a screenshot showing your commands and their output, then:

1. Go to your portfolio repository on GitHub.com and navigate to `assets/screenshots/week-03/`.
2. Click **Add file → Upload files**, drag in your screenshot, and give it a descriptive name (lowercase, hyphens, no spaces — e.g. `cli-simulator-session.png`).
3. Scroll down and click **Commit changes**.
4. Click on the uploaded image's filename to open it — you'll see the image itself displayed on the page.
5. Right-click directly on the image and choose **Copy image address** (Chrome/Edge) or **Copy Image Link** (Firefox).
6. Come back to this file, open the pencil (edit) icon, and add the embed near the bottom of Part B, pasting your copied link in place of the placeholder:

```markdown
![CLI Simulator session screenshot](paste your copied image link here)
```

**If right-click doesn't show that option** (e.g., on some trackpads or tablets): click the small download-arrow icon in the top-right of the image preview instead, then copy the URL from your browser's address bar.

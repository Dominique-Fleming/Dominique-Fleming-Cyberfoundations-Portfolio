# Week 5 Lab 03 — Reading the Grid's Mail (Packet Inspector)

**Student Name:** Dominique D Fleming

**Date Completed:** August 25, 2026

**Module:** 2 — Networking & Cloud Foundations | **Week:** 5  
**Submission Path:** `week-05/labs/lab-03-reading-the-grids-mail.md`

## Overview

Lesson 4 showed you the three panes of a packet analyzer — the packet list, the detail pane, and the filter bar — and told you that professionals live in this tool. This lab is where you stop watching and start driving. You'll open a recorded minute of traffic on The Grid and read it packet by packet: a name lookup (Part B), a handshake and the message that followed it (Part C), and one conversation that refuses to be read at all.

**The capture is the same for every student.** It's a recording, not a live network — fifteen packets, captured once, replayed identically for everyone. That means your numbers should match your classmates' exactly. If yours don't, you've filtered something out; clear the filter and look again.

**Nothing here can break anything.** You are reading a recording. There is no traffic to disturb and nothing to configure.

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| Environment | CyberFoundations **Packet Inspector** — browser-based, inside the Lab Portal. Nothing to install. You will never install Wireshark for this course |
| Where to find it | Lab Portal main navigation, alongside the **CLI Simulator** |
| Capture | "The Grid — Workstation Capture." Canned and identical for every student |
| Prerequisite | Week 5, Lesson 3 (ports, the handshake) and Lesson 4 (the three panes) completed. Lab 01 recommended first — Part B builds directly on it |
| Filters available | `dns` · `icmp` · `tcp` · `http` · `ip.addr == x.x.x.x` · `tcp.port == N` |
| Time | Plan for 30–40 minutes, including this worksheet |

**Before you start:** log into the Lab Portal, open **Week 5 → Packet Inspector**, and load the capture named **"The Grid — Workstation Capture."** You should see a list of packets across the top, an empty detail pane below it, and a filter bar above everything. Keep this worksheet open in a second browser tab so you can record answers as you go.

**Get your screenshot tool ready now.** **Windows:** `Win + Shift + S` · **Mac:** `Cmd + Shift + 4`, then drag to capture. You'll need it twice in this lab, and both screenshots are required.

**A note on filters:** a filter never deletes packets. It hides the ones that don't match so you can concentrate. Clearing the filter box brings everything back. This matters in Part A — count *before* you filter anything.

---

## Part A — Orientation

### Step 1 — Count the Whole Capture

With the filter bar **empty**, look at the packet list and count how many packets the capture contains. Every packet has a number in the first column, so the last row tells you the answer without counting by hand.

The total number of packets in the capture:

```
15
```

### Step 2 — Inventory the Protocols

Scan the **Protocol** column from top to bottom and write down every distinct protocol name you see. There are five. You met all five in Lessons 2, 3 and 4 — this is the first time you're seeing them as labelled traffic rather than as ideas.

The protocols that appear in this capture:

```
DVS, ICMP, TCP, TLS, HTTP
```

### Step 3 — Read the Columns

Four columns do most of the work in a packet analyzer. In your own words — not the Lesson 4 wording — write one plain sentence for each: what does it tell you, and what question does it answer?

What the Source column tells you:

```
This tells me where the packet came from.
```

What the Destination column tells you:

```
This tells me where the packet was going to/arrived
```

What the Protocol column tells you:

```
This tells me the type of communication the packet was doing
```

What the Info column tells you:

```
This is telling me what the packet was doing
```

### Step 4 — Spot Your Own Machine

One address appears more often than any other, and it's the one sending most of the requests. That's the workstation the capture was taken from — the same address you recorded in Lab 01.

The workstation's IP address, and how you worked out it was the workstation:

```
10.20.5.42. I found this to be the workstation ID because it was on every single line(row).
```

---

## Part B — Follow a DNS Lookup

In Lab 01 you ran `dig foundry-archive.grid.local` and read a tidy answer: a name went in, an IP address came out. You saw the *result*. Now you're going to see the actual conversation that produced it — the question travelling across the wire and the answer coming back.

### Step 1 — Filter for DNS

Type `dns` into the filter bar and apply it. The packet list shrinks to the name-lookup traffic only.

The packet numbers that remain after the `dns` filter:

```
1 & 2
```

### Step 2 — Read the Question

Click the first of your two DNS packets and read its Info column and detail pane. This is the query — your workstation asking the Directory Board a question.

The packet number of the query, and the name being asked about:

```
1 & foundry-archive.grid.local
```

The source and destination addresses of the query — who asked, and who was asked:

```
Source Address: this IP address asked
10.20.5.42
Destination Address: this IP address was asked
10.20.5.10
```

### Step 3 — Read the Answer

Now click the second DNS packet. This is the response coming back the other way.

The packet number of the response, and the IP address it returned:

```
2 & 10.20.5.20
```

### Step 4 — Find the Door

DNS doesn't just travel to an address — it travels to a specific **port** on that address, the way Lesson 3 described a numbered door on a building. Open the detail pane on either DNS packet and find the port number the lookup used.

The port number DNS used here:

```
Source Port:
54211
Destination Port:
53
```

### Step 5 — Tie It Back to Lab 01

This is the same lookup you ran with `dig` in Lab 01 — same name, same answer, same DNS server. The difference is the altitude you're viewing it from. `dig` handed you the conclusion; the Packet Inspector shows you the two messages that produced it.

In two or three sentences: what did the packet view show you that `dig` did not?

```
The Packet Inspector showed me the actual DNS request and response packets, including things like the source and destination ports. `dig` just gave me the final lookup result, while the packet view showed me how that result happened across the network.
```

### Step 6 — Capture Screenshot 1 (REQUIRED)

With the `dns` filter still applied and one of the two DNS packets selected, take a screenshot showing the filter bar, the filtered packet list, and the detail pane. Name it exactly **`packet-dns-query.png`**. Upload instructions are in the GitHub Commit section.

## Part C — Doors and the Handshake

Lesson 3 told the TCP handshake as a knock at a door: **SYN** ("knock"), **SYN-ACK** ("who's there — come in"), **ACK** ("thanks"). You're about to watch one happen.

### Step 1 — Filter for Port 443

Clear the `dns` filter and enter `tcp.port == 443` instead. Port 443 is HTTPS — one of the well-known doors from Lesson 3.

The packet numbers that remain after the `tcp.port == 443` filter:

```
7, 8, 9, 10
```

### Step 2 — Identify the Three-Step Handshake

Three of those packets are the handshake itself. Find each one by reading the flags in the Info column, and record its number, its direction (which address sent it to which), and which step of the handshake it is.

The SYN — packet number and direction:

```
7 SYN 51514 → 443
```

The SYN-ACK — packet number and direction:

```
8 SYN-ACK 443 → 51514
```

The ACK — packet number and direction:

```
9 ACK 51514 → 443
```

### Step 3 — Notice the Two Port Numbers

Look at the Info column on the SYN packet. Two port numbers appear: a high, odd-looking one on your workstation's side, and 443 on the server's side. Only one of them is a "well-known door" — the other is a temporary one your machine picked for this conversation.

The two port numbers, and which belongs to the server:

```
Source Port:
51514- This is the temp one picked for the conversation
Destination Port:
443 (https) This is the server's
```

### Step 4 — Switch to the Plain Conversation

Clear the filter and enter `http` instead. This is a different conversation to a different machine on The Grid — the notice board — on port 80.

The packet numbers that remain after the `http` filter:

```
14 & 15
```

### Step 5 — Open the Request and Read It

Click **packet 14** and expand its detail pane all the way. Unlike everything you've read so far, this packet's contents are ordinary text — you can simply read them, the way you'd read a note left on a desk.

The request line at the top of packet 14 (the method, the page, and the version):

```
GET /shift-notice.html HTTP/1.1
```

The Host line — which machine the request was addressed to:

```
Host: grid-notice.grid.local
```

Every other readable line in packet 14's detail pane:

```
GET /shift-notice.html HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: GridBrowser/2.4
X-Staff-Code: FOUNDRY-2026-STOREROOM
```

### Step 6 — Notice What You Just Read

One of those lines is not like the others. It carries a value that looks like an internal code rather than a technical setting.

The name of that header and the exact value it carries:

```
X-Staff-Code: FOUNDRY-2026-STOREROOM
```

In one or two sentences: if you were sitting on this network with a packet analyzer open, what would you now know that you were never meant to know?

```
I would now know the internal staff code: `FOUNDRY-2026-STOREROOM`. Because it was sent over plain HTTP, I could read it directly from the captured traffic.
```

### Step 7 — Capture Screenshot 2 (REQUIRED)

With the `http` filter applied and **packet 14** selected and expanded so the readable lines are visible, take a screenshot. Name it exactly **`packet-http-plaintext.png`**.

### Step 8 — Now Try to Read the Other One

Clear the filter and click **packet 10** — the TLS Client Hello from the port 443 conversation you examined in Steps 1–3. Expand its detail pane and try to read it the same way you just read packet 14.

What packet 10's detail pane shows you, described in your own words:

```
Packet 10 shows that the connection is using TLS/HTTPS, so the actual data is scrambled and not readable like the HTTP packet was. I can still see things like the source, destination, and port 443, but I can’t read the actual message inside.
```

Compare it to packet 14 — what can you still tell about packet 10 from the packet list, even though you can't read its contents?

```
Even though I can’t read packet 10’s contents, I can still see who sent it, where it was going, and that it was using TLS over port 443. So I know it was secure HTTPS traffic between my computer and the server, but the actual message itself is hidden.

```

**Don't chase this yet.** You've just found something real, and the explanation is a later part of this course. For now, sit with the observation: two conversations, one legible and one not. Analysis Question 4 asks what you make of it.

## Analysis Questions

**Analysis Question 1.** In Part A you counted the packets before applying any filter. Explain why a filter is a *view* rather than a deletion, and describe a situation where forgetting that could lead an analyst to a wrong conclusion. *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
A filter is just a view of the packets that match what I’m looking for. It does not delete the other packets; they are still in the capture. If I forget that, I could look at a filtered view, think those are the only packets that exist, and make the wrong call about what actually happened on the network.
```

**Analysis Question 2.** You have now seen the same DNS lookup twice — once as `dig` output in Lab 01, once as two packets here. Describe what each view is good for, and name one investigation where you would specifically want the packet view. *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
`dig` is good for quickly showing me whether a name resolves and what IP address it points to. The packet view is better when I need to see the actual DNS request and response moving across the network. I would want the packet view if I was investigating whether a DNS request was sent but never got a reply.
```

**Analysis Question 3.** The handshake took three packets and about three milliseconds before a single byte of real content moved. Using the knock-at-the-door analogy from Lesson 3, explain what those three packets accomplish and why a connection would be less reliable without them. *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
The three packets are basically the knock, the answer, and the “okay” before any real data is sent. They make sure both sides are there, ready, and able to communicate. Without that handshake, data could be sent before the other side is ready, which would make the connection less reliable.
```

**Analysis Question 4.** You read packet 14 word for word, and packet 10 not at all — same capture, same network, same workstation. What do you think explains the difference between them? And why does it matter that the one you *could* read contained a staff code? You are not expected to know the mechanism yet; give us your best reasoning from what you observed. *(Minimum 4 sentences.)*

```
Packet 14 was plain HTTP, so I could read everything inside it. Packet 10 used HTTPS, so the actual content was scrambled and hidden from me. That matters because packet 14 exposed a staff code that someone on the network was probably not supposed to see. If that kind of information is sent in plain text, anyone watching the traffic could potentially read it.
